# Machine Learning Antibody Design

Imperial College London: MSc Digital Chemistry with AI and Automation \
Research Project conducted by Jay Badland-Shaw, supervised by Francesco Aprile and Barbara Bravi.

## Overview

This project is designed to add onto the TransformerBeta pipeline, providing a measure of promiscuity, i.e. how likely a designed peptide is to bind to another epitope other than the target epitope. A promiscous peptide is defined in this case as an 8-mer epitope that is likely to bind with high affinity to several other non-target binding sites. The pipeline is a multi-class classification architecture, where the first classification task detects high probability binders, and the second determines the binding strength of the postive outcomes from the first task. 

This helps with antibody design by providing additional insight into the behaivour of the designed binders. It also contributes to a wider conversation surrounding specificity in antibody design, touching on areas such as minimising off-target pharmacological effects caused by promiscuous peptides. 



## Usage

The model pipeline inputs the .csv file generated by TransformerBeta, and runs it through the two classifcation models:

Once completed, a user will be provided with a .csv file containing the peptide, the promiscuity score, and the number of 'hits' a given peptide had against the database. \
Users also have the option to generate histograms showing the distribution of binding scores across the dataset; this helps to determine what form the promiscuity takes and gain further additional insight.



## Installation

**Files necessary for use:** 

'model_training_data.csv' \
an output_analysis.csv file from TransformerBeta (or any .csv file containing a list of peptide) \
'Promiscuity Predictions.ipynb'


**Python Requirements** 

To run the Promiscuity Score Pipeline, the following python modules are required:
- numpy
- pandas
- random
- sklearn
- tqdm
- matplotlib
- torch
